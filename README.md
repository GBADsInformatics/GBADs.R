# GBADs

Welcome is the GBADs (Global Burden of Animal Diseases) R package repository!

GBADs runs a novel compartmentalized agent-based model called AHLE (Animal Health Loss Envelope) used to estimate production losses in livestock such as cattle, poultry, and small ruminants within developing countries like Ethiopia.
